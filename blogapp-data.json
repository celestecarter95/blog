Slowly I developed a better vim experience as I worked in vim. If you are a new vim then you are in the right place! I will give you step-by-step commands to learn. They go from most convenient, from my experience, to least. So the first few should be easy to remember since they help you go faster in vim.\r\n\r\nThe best way to learn new vim commands is to work in vim, stop and know there has to be an easier way to navigate or edit in vim and then go find that command. Although sometimes it is nice to have a cheat sheet to know those commands exist in the first place.\r\n\r\nI will try to remember all the commands I do. Vim has become a muscle memory for me, so sometimes I think I don't know a command, but it turns out that my fingers know it and I just don't know the characters of the command.\r\n\r\nCommands: (note, I will put new lines between learning steps, so that the commands to learn will be in bundles.)\r\n\r\n(Optional Command)\r\nIf you want to break a bad habit before it even begins, I suggest using the h, j, k, and l commands. They represent a way for you to keep your fingers on the keyboard the whole time. Don't use the arrow keys. You have to take your hands off the keyboard in order to use them and that slows you down. A good rule for good programmers is to never let your hands leave the keyboard.\r\n\r\nh = move left (left arrow)\r\nj = move up (up arrow)\r\nk = move down (down arrow)\r\nl = move right (right arrow)\r\n\r\nAt first this is weird by if you start with these then you never have to break a bad habit with using that arrow keys. I had to break a bad habit. If you are one of those people who want to learn this later, then that is fine. I will tell you at which step-by-step you should use start using them.\r\n\r\ni = insert mode (allows you to type normally), inserts behind the character you are currently on\r\nesc = exit button will let you get out of insert mode so you can use commands\r\n:q = quit file\r\n:w = write file\r\n:qw = write and quit file\r\n\r\nI use :w so often that when I am trying to save things that aren't on vim I end up typing :w.\r\n\r\ndd = deletes line but you can use p or P to paste it back in\r\np = paste line below\r\nP = paste line above\r\nZZ = save and quit (a faster command then :wq)\r\n\r\n:q! = force quit file (any changes you made to file will not be saved)\r\ngg = go to the top of the file\r\nG = go to the bottom of the file\r\n0 = go to beginning of line\r\n$ = go to ending of line\r\n\r\nV = lets you highlight lines of code then to use other commands to use multiple lines of code\r\nLines to use with the V command:\r\n> = lets you indent\r\n< = lets you undo indentation\r\nd = deletes your code but don't worry you can use P or p to paste it back in\r\n\r\nu = undo, undoes your last edit\r\n<ctr>R = redo, redoes your last edit\r\n. = repeats your last command so you don't have to retype the command (words well with bit commands like using V and then highlight lines of code and then indenting all those lines of code). If you click the . command it allows you to repeat those commands.\r\n/ = lets you search whatever you put after it, example:\r\n/hello = finds all words hello (case sensitive)\r\n\r\nI = insert mode, inserts you at the very beginning of the line of code\r\no = new line bellow and puts you in insert mode\r\nO = new line above and puts you in insert mode\r\n\r\nw = move over a word\r\nb = move back a word\r\nYou can specify how many words you want to move to or back from by putting a number in front of it like this:\r\n5w = move over five words\r\n8b = move back eight words\r\n4d = delete four words\r\n\r\n} = moves you down to a line with a newline and no code\r\n{ = moves you up to a line with a newline and no code", "picture": "", "blog_poster": "Celeste", "title": "Vim Learning Commands Step-By-Step", "active": true, "keywords": "Programming Editor Command-line", "category": [3], "pub_date": "2015-09-15T22:20:44.167Z"}, "model": "blogapp.post", "pk": 2}, {"fields": {"body": "Caramel \r\n2 c sugar\r\n1 c Karo syrup\r\n1 cube butter\r\n\r\nIn a 4 qt sauce pan constantly stir on high until the butter is melted then add:\r\n\r\n1 c cream\r\n\r\nBoil until soft ball 234 degrees (5 to 7 minutes).
